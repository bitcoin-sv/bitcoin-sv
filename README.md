Bitcoin SV
===========

*Note: version 0.2.2 is an optional beta release for the BSV mainnet; however it is a required update
for the Scaling Test Network. We encourage miners to test this release carefully
and maintain a v0.2.1 node available on standby.*

What is Bitcoin SV?
-------------------

[Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision)](https://bitcoinsv.io/) is the original Bitcoin.  It restores the original Bitcoin 
protocol, will keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.  Bitcoin SV will maintain the vision set out by Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s white paper in 2008.  This Github repository provides open-source software to enable use of Bitcoin SV.
